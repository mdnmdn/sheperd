> ⚠️ **SUPER EARLY DEVELOPMENT** ⚠️
> 
> This project is in the very early stages of development. Nothing is stable, APIs will change, and features are incomplete. Use at your own risk!

A wanna be modern process manager for production applications, inspired by PM2.

## 🚧 Development Status

This project is currently in **super early development**. What this means:

- ❌ **Not ready for production use**
- ❌ **APIs are unstable and will change**
- ❌ **Features are incomplete or missing**
- ❌ **Documentation is minimal**
- ❌ **No guarantees about backwards compatibility**

## 🎯 Planned Features

Sheperd aims to be a modern, Rust-based process manager with features like:

- [ ] Process lifecycle management (start, stop, restart, reload)
- [ ] Configuration file support (YAML, JSON)
- [ ] Process monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Log management and rotation
- [ ] Clustering and load balancing
- [ ] Web dashboard and API
- [ ] Systemd integration
- [ ] Docker support
- [ ] Hot reloading
- [ ] Environment management

## 🛠️ Current State

Currently, this is mostly a Cargo.toml file with dependencies. The actual implementation is yet to be written.

## 📋 Requirements

- Rust 1.70+ (uses 2021 edition)
- Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS)

## 🚀 Installation (When Ready)

```bash
# This doesn't work yet!
cargo install sheperd
```

## 📖 Usage (Planned)

```bash
# These commands don't exist yet!
sheperd start myapp.js
sheperd list
sheperd stop myapp
sheperd restart myapp
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Since this is in super early development, contributions are welcome but expect rapid changes. Please:

1. Check existing issues before creating new ones
2. Expect breaking changes in every commit
3. Be patient with incomplete features

## ⚡ Inspiration

This project is inspired by [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/), the excellent Node.js process manager, but aims to be a more modern, cross-language solution built in Rust.
